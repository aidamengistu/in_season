<p id="aboutMe">Welcome to In Season!  In Season is a website that allows you to look up which fruits and vegetables are in season, find recipes with them and locate your nearest farmer's market.  <br>My name is Aida Mengistu and I designed this website as my final portfolio piece for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.  In Season was built using MongoDB, AngularJS and Sails.  It is powered by two APIs: Big Oven Recipes and USDA Farmer's Markets API.  <br>If you would like to get in touch with me, please email me at aidamengistu@gmail.com.  I can also be reached by phone at (206)371-1202.</p>
